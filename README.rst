SailPoint IDN API and utils


The aim of this project is to allow for an easy and fast way to build python
scripts for common implementation and administration tasks for SailPoint
IdentityNow.

This project provides integration with the SailPoint IdentityNow APIs,
including the cc, v2, v3, and beta APIs. A level of abstraction is provided
which removes the need to call each of the lower level APIs calls, or know
which particular API you need to call.

Documentation
================
Documentation as well as a Jupyter Notebook is available in the `dist/docs`
directory of the source.

You can also find the documentation for the python module at: 
`SailPoint GitHub Page <https://fitchgroup.github.io/sailpoint/dist/docs/index.html>`_

Examples on how to use the module can be found in the Jupyter Notebook, which
can be run in `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ or `Google Colab
<https://colab.research.google.com/>`_. Alternatively you can find the
examples documented at `Sailpoint Notebook Examples <https://fitchgroup.github.io/sailpoint/dist/docs/sailpoint_notebook_examples.html>`_.

For full documentation about the IdentityNow API see https://developer.sailpoint.com/
