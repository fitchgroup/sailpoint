SailPoint IDN API and utils


The aim of this project is to allow for an easy and fast way to build python
scripts for common implementation and administration tasks needed when
working with SailPoint IdentityNow.

This project provides integration with the SailPoint IdentityNow APIs,
including the cc, v2, v3, and beta APIs. A level of abstraction is provided
which removes the need to call each of the lower level APIs calls, or know
which particular API you need to call.

For full documentation about the IdentityNow API see https://developer.sailpoint.com/
